###About this work

 I would like have many samples good to learn in how to build things correctly. But we know we have many ways to do ; but not one simple to start. After a long time i started build to myself this samples, but i dont see some future if i just take it to myself. So im sharing what i have been learned till now about opencv java with samples and at least some tricks "i dont see them like tricks but is the first word come at my mind". 

 i wish you could use it and make something good. At least i hope people help me back. 

###Linux Setup on Netbeans

-Obs:i like to compile opencv to specific to my machine , and i never used on linux this setup by packages

Path to compiled libs when you go find .so: -Djava.library.path="path_where_you_compiled_opencv/lib"
path to jni jar when you are going to add libs: path_where_you_compiled_opencv/bin/opencv-310.jar
On java add this on main call at your java app: System.loadLibrary(Core.NATIVE_LIBRARY_NAME);

###Windows setup on Netbeans

Path to compiled libs when you go find .dll: -Djava.library.path="C:\opencv\build\java\x64\"
path to jni jar when you are going to add libs: C:\opencv\build\java\opencv-310.jar
On java add this on main : System.loadLibrary(Core.NATIVE_LIBRARY_NAME);
